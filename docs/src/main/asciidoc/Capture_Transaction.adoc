= APS Capture Transaction

== Prerequisites
Before performing a Capture transaction with the PayPal Payment Services gateway, you'll first need to set up your environment as described in the link:Environment_Setup.adoc[Environment Setup Guide].

== Executing a Capture Transaction
Use the following code snippet to perform a Capture transaction:

[source,java]
----

public class Capture {

 @Autowired
 PayPalCheckoutTransactionService transactionService;
	
 public void performCapture() {

		 CurrencyUnit currency = Monetary.getCurrency(currencyCode);
		 MonetaryAmount transactionTotal = Monetary.getDefaultAmountFactory().setCurrency(currency).setNumber(amount).create();
		
		 PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest()
                .paymentId(paymentId)
                .transactionTotal(transactionTotal)
                .orderSubtotal(transactionTotal)
		        .paymentOwnerType("BLC_CART")
		        .paymentOwnerId(cartId)
		        .additionalField(MessageConstants.AUTHORIZATIONID, "AuthorizationId")
                .transactionReferenceId(transactionReferenceId);

	 	PaymentResponse paymentResponse = transactionService.capture(paymentRequest);

		paymentResponse.isSuccessful();
		paymentResponse.getGatewayResponseCode(); //PayPa Response Code
		paymentResponse.getFailureType(); // Failure type in case the transaction was not successful.
	  	paymentResponse.getResponseMap().get(MessageConstants.CAPTUREID); // PayPal Capture id
	   	paymentResponse.getRawResponse(); // PayPal Raw response stored as a JSON object
	}
}
----

To set additional fields in the PaymentRequest, use method

[source,java]
---- 
PaymentRequest.additionalField(key, value)
---- 
To get values from responseMap, use 

[source,java]
---- 
PaymentResponse.getResponseMap().get(key, value)
----

To get the transaction reference ID from response:

[source,java]
---- 
PaymentResponse.getTransactionReferenceId()
----
