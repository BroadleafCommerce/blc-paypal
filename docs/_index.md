# Paypal Module

Broadleaf Commerce currently offers integration with PayPal Checkout and the REST API. 
See [Getting Started With PayPao Checkout](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/) for more information.

> Note: Beginning with 2.8.0+, Broadleaf's PayPal Module has been re-factored to drop support for the legacy PayPal Express Checkout
flows (including integration with the NVP APIs) in favor of PayPal Checkout + Smart Payments and integration with
PayPal's REST API.
